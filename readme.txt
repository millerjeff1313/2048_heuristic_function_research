This repository contains three python scripts. The first one is game.py, this is the basic code for the game 2048. This can be run on its own for 
the user to play the game.

The second script is agent.py. This will create a bot to play the game using one or more of the specific heuristics in conjunction with the Minimax algorithm.
If not heuristic function is specified, the agent will play randomly.

The last script is iterator.py, which will make some specific number of bots for a given heuristic mode, then find the statistics for that bot mode.

The findings from this research are detailed in the 2048_heuristic_function_paper.pdf file.
